# Kubernetes Operator with Golang

Welcome to the Kubernetes Operator with Golang project! In this project, we explore creating operators for Kubernetes using Golang. 

## Introduction
In this project, we'll delve into the creation of operators for Kubernetes. Operators are programs written for Kubernetes that help maintain the desired state of resources using custom controllers. They interact with the Kubernetes API server to manage resources based on custom definitions.

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a custom operator that can scale up or down resources based on specified time durations. For instance, if you anticipate increased traffic on a service between 5 AM to 10 AM, you might want to scale up the replicas during that time, and then scale them down during off-peak hours.

## Tech Stack
- **Operator SDK**: We'll be using the Operator SDK to create our operator. It provides a framework for building Kubernetes operators using the Go programming language.
- **Kubernetes**: The project involves interacting with Kubernetes clusters to manage resources and controllers.
- **Golang**: The operator will be written in Golang, leveraging its performance and concurrency features.

## Project Structure
- `API`: Contains the definition of the custom resource (`scalar`) that our operator will manage.
- `Controller`: Houses the logic for the controller that reconciles the state of the cluster based on the custom resource definitions.
- `config`: Contains configurations and manifests for deploying the operator and custom resources.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally:
1. Initialize the project with the Operator SDK.
2. Define the custom resource (`scalar`) with the desired properties such as start time, end time, and replicas.
3. Implement the controller logic to scale resources based on the specified time durations.
4. Build and deploy the operator to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Usage
1. Deploy the operator to your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Create custom resources (`scalar`) to define the scaling behavior for your deployments.
3. Monitor the logs to see the reconciliation process in action.
